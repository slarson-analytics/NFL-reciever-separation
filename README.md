# NFL Receiver Separation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NFL player tracking data to measure in-air separation gain (IASG) and examine how late-window separation relates to completion probability.

## Data
- NFL player tracking data
- Play-by-play and route-level information

## Methods
- Calculated pre-throw vs. post-throw separation metrics
- Analyzed in-air separation gain (IASG)
- Linked separation metrics to completion probability
- Created visualizations to compare routes and receiver performance

## Key Takeaways
- Late-window separation captures receiver skill better than pre-throw separation
- Certain routes allow receivers to generate separation after the ball is thrown
- IASG provides additional context beyond traditional separation metrics

## Tools Used
- R 
- Data visualization libraries
- Statistical analysis
